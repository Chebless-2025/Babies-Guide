        <h1>NUTRITION: 2-4 MONTHS</h1>
   <p> <b>  1. Primary Nutrition Source: </b>Breast Milk or Formula

        Breast Milk: The ideal source of nutrition, containing the right balance of nutrients, antibodies, and enzymes to support the baby's immune system.
        
        Infant Formula: If breastfeeding isn't an option, iron-fortified formula is the recommended alternative. Formulas are designed to mimic breast milk as closely as possible.</p>
        
        
        <p><b>2. Feeding Frequency and Quantity:</b>
        
        Breastfed Babies: Typically feed every 2 to 3 hours, about 8-12 times per day. Babies may consume 2-4 ounces (60-120 ml) per feeding, increasing gradually as they grow.
        
        Formula-Fed Babies: Usually feed every 3 to 4 hours, consuming around 4-6 ounces (120-180 ml) per feeding by the age of 4 months.
        
        Hunger Cues: Look for signs like sucking on fists, lip-smacking, rooting (turning head towards the breast), and fussiness.</p>
        
        
       <p><b> 3. Signs of Adequate Nutrition</b></p>
        
        <p><b>3. Signs of Adequate Nutrition:</b>

        Weight Gain: Babies typically gain about 5-7 ounces (140-200 grams) per week at this age.
        
        Diaper Output: 6-8 wet diapers per day and regular bowel movements (breastfed babies may have more frequent or irregular stools).</p>
        
        
       <p><b> 4. Avoid Solid Foods:</b>
        
        At this age, babies' digestive systems are not mature enough for solids. The introduction of solid foods generally starts around 6 months unless advised otherwise by a pediatrician.</p>
        
        
       <p><b> 5. Vitamin D Supplementation</b>
        
        Breastfed Babies: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends 400 IU of vitamin D per day starting from the first few days of life.
        
        Formula-Fed Babies: If consuming less than 32 ounces (1 liter) of formula per day, a vitamin D supplement may also be needed.</p>
        
        
        <p><b>6. Hydration:</b>
        
        Babies typically do not need additional water. Breast milk and formula provide adequate hydration.</p>


<p><b>7. Common Concerns:</b>

Spit-Up and Reflux: Small amounts of spit-up are normal. Keeping the baby upright after feeding can help.

Colic and Gas: Burp the baby regularly during and after feeds to reduce discomfort.</p>


<p><b>8. Things to Avoid:</b></p>

<p>No Cowâ€™s Milk: Before the age of 1 year, babies should not be given cow's milk as a primary drink.</p>

<p>No Honey: Honey can cause infant botulism and should not be given to babies under 1 year old.</p>

<p>No Juice or Water: These are not necessary and can interfere with nutrient intake.</p>
