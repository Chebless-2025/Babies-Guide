                        <P>Following a strict feeding schedule isn't recommended – or possible – for young babies.<br>
                             Right now, your goal is to get to know your baby and help them get a healthy start. Feed your baby on demand, watching their hunger cues, so they stay hydrated and put on weight. 

                            Even though your daily routine with your baby is all over the place at this point – and that's completely normal .<br>
                             It can be a big help to get a general idea of what these first couple of months will be like.<br>
                              Below, you'll find sample schedules for 1- and 2-month-olds based on those of real parents and reviewed by a pediatrician on our Medical Advisory Board.<br>
                            
                            Some general things to keep in mind as you're getting used to your baby's feeding patterns:<br>
                            
                                Breastfeed babies tend to eat more frequently than formula-fed babies, and may eat less during each feeding.
                                Exclusively breastfed babies eat about eight to 12 times over a 24-hour period when they're 1 and 2 months old.<br>
                                 Here's how to tell whether your baby's getting enough breast milk.<br>
                                Formula-fed babies will eat around six to eight times a day at 1 and 2 months old. They'll typically have 4 ounces every three to four hours for a total of 24 to 32 ounces of formula each day. Here's how to tell if your baby's getting enough formula.</P>

<h2>Tips for feeding your 1- or 2-month-old</h2>
<p>
    Whether you're breastfeeding or formula feeding, here are a few basics and tips for getting off to a great start.

    Many babies need help learning to breastfeed. Encourage a healthy latch by holding your breast in one hand and the back of your baby's head in another. Once they open wide, gently push your entire nipple toward the back of your baby's open mouth.
    Milk production is a business of supply and demand.<br>
     The more you nurse your baby, the more your body gets the message that it needs to make milk. In the earliest days of breastfeeding, it's often best to focus less on scheduling and more on feeding your baby often for 10 to 20 minutes on each side.
    One of the best ways to care for your baby is by taking care of yourself.<br>
     Breastfeeding mothers need 450 to 500 extra calories a day, so eat plenty of nutrient-dense food. Sleep deprivation and stress could also hurt your milk supply, so rely on your partner, family members, and friends as much as possible when things are tough so you can get some rest.
    If you're combination feeding, wait until your baby is about 1 month old if possible before introducing them to a bottle. When you're ready, offer the bottle in place of nursing or after nursing. Considering enlisting help for this task, since some babies may reject the bottle if it comes from the same person who breastfeeds them.
    Whether you're formula feeding or pumping and giving bottles, it's a good idea to practice paced bottle feeding.<br>
     When it's time to eat, hold your baby more upright to help slow the flow of milk or formula from the bottle. Take a break every half ounce to burp your baby before offering more milk. If your baby is showing signs of being full, stop offering the bottle rather than encouraging them to finish it.
    To ensure your baby is getting enough milk, you can keep track of their feedings and wet and dirty diapers. After their first week of life, it's normal for babies to wet four to eight diapers daily. Your baby's doctor will track your baby's weight closely at all well-baby visits and mark it on their growth chart. Most 1- and 2-month-old babies gain an average of a half an ounce to an ounce each day.
    If you're breastfeeding, you and your baby are learning a new and challenging skill.<br>
     Many pediatrician's offices and hospitals offer lactation support groups or one-on-one appointments with a lactation consultant. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're struggling.
    If you're feeling blue at all, reach out to your healthcare provider for support and resources for help. Postpartum depression affects 1 in 8 moms in the U.S., so you're not alone.<br>
